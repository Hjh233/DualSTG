# Poison Datasets with two kinds of features
# Irrelevant features
# generated by purely random noise 
# Overwhelmed features
# However it's very hard to define over whelmed features.
# The idel definition should be: 
# The performance boost of adding this feature is marginal
# we generate this kind of features by
# linearly combining the original features with a random noise.
# a1 * important feature1 + a2 * important feature2 + lambda * noise
